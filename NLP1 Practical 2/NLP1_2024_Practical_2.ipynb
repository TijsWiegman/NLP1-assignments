But this time, next to completing the notebook, **you are expected to write a four-page scientific report with your findings**. Please still submit the notebook together with your scientific report so that we can reproduce your experiments. (Note: if you find it useful, you can split this notebook into multiple notebooks. If you do so, keep it mind that it should be possible for your TAs to reproduce the entire content of the notebooks without having to ask for clarifications or to copy and paste functions from one sub-notebook to another.) Make sure your code corresponds to the description you give in the report; we will deduct points if this is not the case. **Make sure you run all your code before submitting the notebook, and do not leave unnecessary print statements / cells in your notebook that are not intended for the grader.**\n",

In practice, if your model overfits, this means that it will be very good at predicting (or \"remembering\") the sentiment of the training set, but unable to generalise to new, unseen data in the test set. This is undesirable and one technique to mitigate this issue is *dropout*.\n",

A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect that a model relies on single parameters for prediction (e.g. if $h^{\\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable to obtain better generalisation to unseen data."

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

        "We expect you to use the following structure:\n",
        "1. Introduction (~1 page) - describe the problem, your research questions and goals, a summary of your findings and contributions. Please cite related work (models, data set) as part of your introduction here, since this is a short paper.\n",
        "    - Introduce the task and the main goal\n",
        "    - Present your research questions\n",
        "    - Motivate the importance of the questions\n",
        "    - Present and explain your expectations\n",
        "    - Make clear whether the research questions are addressed or not addressed in the literature\n",
        "    - Describe the approach you use to answer the research questions\n",
        "    - Summarise your findings\n",
        "2. Background (~1/2-1 page) -\n",
        "cover the main techniques (\"building blocks\") used in your project (e.g. word embeddings, LSTM, Tree-LSTM) and intuitions behind them. Be accurate and concise.\n",
        "    - How does each technique work? (Don't just copy the formulas)\n",
        "    - What is the relation between the techniques?\n",
        "3. Models (~1/2 page) - Describe the architecture of the final models.\n",
        "    - How do you use LSTM or Tree-LSTM for the sentiment classification task?\n",
        "    - What layers do you have, how do you do classification?\n",
        "    - What is your loss function?\n",
        "    - Etc.\n",
        "4. Experiments (~1/2 page) - Describe your experimental setup. This section should allow someone else to reproduce your experiments. Describe how you evaluate the models.\n",
        "    - Task and the data\n",
        "    - Training (model, data, parameters and hyper parameters, training algorithms, supervision signals, etc.)\n",
        "    - Evaluation (e.g. metrics)\n",
        "5. Results and Analysis (~1 page). Present the results and analyse your findings.\n",
        "    - Answer each of the research questions you raised in the introduction.\n",
        "    - Use figures and tables to highlight interesting patterns\n",
        "    - What are the factors that make model A better than model B in task C? Investigate to prove their effect!\n",
        "6. Conclusion (~1/4 page). Present the conclusions that can be drawn from your experiments.\n",
        "    - What have you learned from you experiments?\n",
        "    - How do your findings relate to what is already known in the literature?\n",
        "    - Were the results as expected? Any surprising results? Why?\n",
        "    - Based on what you learned, what would you suggest doing next?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "General Tips:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Math notation – define each variable (either in running text, or in a pseudo-legenda after or before the equation).\n",
        "- Define technical terminology you need.\n",
        "- Avoid colloquial language – everything can be said in a scientific-sounding way.\n",
        "- Avoid lengthy sentences, stay to the point.\n",
        "- Do not spend space on \"obvious\" things.\n",
        "- Do not go over the page limit. (We will deduct points for that.)\n",
        "- The page limit is 4 pages excluding references and appendix. This is a strict limit; points will be deducted for longer reports.\n",
        "- There is no strict limit to references and appendix. However, the report needs to remain fully self-contained: the appendix should only include content that is not necessary to understand your work. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of your work can be put into the appendix.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "An ideal report:\n",
        "- Precise, scientific, technical, to the point\n",
        "  - Little general “waffle”/chit-chat\n",
        "- Not boring – because you don’t explain obvious things too much\n",
        "- Efficient delivery of (only) the facts that we need to know to understand/reimplement\n",
        "- Results visually well-presented and described with the correct priority of importance of sub-results\n",
        "- Insightful analysis – speculation should connect to something interesting and not be too much; the reader “learns something new”\n",
        "- No typos, no colloquialisms – well-considered language\n",
        "- This normally means several re-draftings (re-orderings of information)\n"
